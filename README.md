### Hey! My name is Matthew. I'm currently going into my senior year at DigiPen Institute of Technology, and I'm looking for internship work for the tail end of 2021 and 2022.

I'm currently working on a summer project with friends, based in the Unreal Engine, which is a new experience for me. I've used Unity extensively in the past, but Unreal is a whole new ball game. 

Feel free to contact me about any of the work I upload here or check out my linkedin page at https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmatthewklingman/
